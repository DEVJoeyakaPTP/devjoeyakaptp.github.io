            A paragraph is a section of text that pertains to a single theme and is designated by an indent or a line
            break. Paragraphs are at least one sentence long and are usually one part of a larger whole.

            Visually, a paragraph is a "chunk" of text on a page with space above and below. Each one contains a point
            or idea that should connect to the paragraphs around it.

        <h1>Section 3 : How to write?</h1>
        <p>
            Let’s dive right into paragraph structure. A basic paragraph has five sentences: one topic sentence, three
            supporting sentences, and one concluding sentence.

            The first sentence,<span><a href="#001">sec-1</a></span> or topic sentence, introduces the main idea that will be presented in the paragraph; the
            supporting sentences dissect and support the main idea, sometimes with statistics or hard evidence; and the
            concluding sentence answers the question, “So what?”
